When you are reading this I have already set up some basic website page and added some front-end code using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/ 'Svelte dev site'), I have added a minimal design using *Bootstrap*, and arranged some hosting and namespace. \n\nThere are a lot of things I want to experiment with on this site. For starters I would like to have this page look nice and add some features to make it feel like an enjoyable site. Next it would be nice if I could easily add some stories and manage the content of the site a little bit. After that I can go any direction I like and experiment a little bit."

        "content": "Here it is, already the second release of my Svelte learning journey. After the first release I quickly cleaned up the code and added markdown support to make the texts look nicer. I also removed the Bootstrap code and applied the Svelte [Nested Components](https://svelte.dev/examples#nested-components) allowing me to style this more to my own needs.  \n\n For putting this site live I used the minimal Digital Ocean Droplet running Docker with a container running NGINX and a container running my Svelte code. I have connected my domain name to the IP of the container and now I can access my site through [thijsiedema.com](http://thijsiedema.com/). FInally I started looking into adding an SSL certificate so that I can get some HTTPS working."
