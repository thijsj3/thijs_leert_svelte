My goal with this website is to learn all kinds of techniques related to software development, web programming and everything around it. When you are reading this I have already set up some basic website page and added some front-end code using Svelte (https://svelte.dev/), I have added a minimal design using Bootstrap, and arranged some hosting and namespace.There are a lot of things I want to experiment with on this site. For starters I would like to have this page look nice and add some features to make it feel like an enjoyable site. Next it would be nice if I could easily add some stories and manage the content of the site a little bit. After that I can go any direction I like and experiment a little bit."
